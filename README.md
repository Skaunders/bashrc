bashrc
======

My customized and extensible bashrc setup.

### Installation
Open command prompt, cd into the bashrc folder, and run ./install.sh

### Notes
This version of bashrc contains a modification of bashrc.postcustom that labels the shell window as [user]@[hostname]. To restore to deafult, comment out or delete uncommented portion of bashrc.postcustom.
